    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix the flour and salt together. Add the yeast to warm water and let it stand for a few minutes for bubbles or foam to appear.
            Pour yeasty water into the flour bowl slowly, mixing with a spoon at the same time. Once all the water has been added, add olive oil and mix with a spoon to combine</li>
        <li>Transfer the dough to a bench that's been dusted with flour. Knead with your hands for about 10 minutes until the dough is elastic and smooth</li>
        <li>Roll into a ball, tucking under the sides and allow to rest covered with a damp tea towel or plastic wrap for 30 -60 mintues
            The dough would have doubled in size. Divide into 3 even balls then add a touch of olive oil to the top of the balls and let them rest covered with cling wrap or a damp cloth for a minimum of 2 hours</li>
        <li>Peheat oven to its highest setting for 30 minutes with your pizza stone or oven tray inside. 
            To make the pizza shape, dust your bench with semolina flour and using your hands gently stretch into a pizza shape</li>
        <li>Add your tomato sauce and favourite toppings, all except the mozzarella cheese. Drizzle with olive oil and brush some onto the crust too</li>
        <li>Gently move the pizza base to your heated pizza pan or oven tray. Cook in the oven on the lowest level for approximately 4-5 minutes
            Remove from oven, add mozzarella cheese and place back in the oven for 3-4 minutes until the cheese has melted.
            Tear over some fresh basil leaves and enjoy</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>When kneading the pizza dough, add a dusting of flour to your bench or table. If the dough is too wet or sticky, add a touch of flour</li>
        <li>When allowing the dough balls to rest in a bowl or tray, add a dusting of flour or some olive oil to the bottom of the tray or bowl first. This ensures the dough won't get stuck to the bottom. Also, add a touch of olive oil to the top of the dough balls before they rest</li>
        <li>If resting the dough balls overnight in the fridge, wrap your tray well with cling wrap so no air can come inside. You'll also need to allow the dough to come back to room temperature for 2-3 hours before the pizza is going to be made</li>
        <li>When making the pizza shape and stretching the base, be very gentle especially if you have let your dough rest overnight as it will be very soft and can tear easily</li>
        <li>Dust your bench with semolina flour, as it's much easier to stretch the dough without it sticking. The less the dough is touched the better when stretching the dough</li>
        <li>If using fresh mozzarella cheese which is in water, you'll need to dry out the excess liquid. Itâ€™s best to cut it into strips or in smaller pieces, and place the cheese on paper towels or a colander for at least a few hours or overnight to dry out the excess water. If you miss this step, water puddles will come out of the cheese when it's cooked and you'll have a watery pizza</li>
