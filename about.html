    <h3>My Ethos</h3>
    <p>As a proud italian, I have been cooking and serving up only the most authenthic italian dishes for most of my career. In my many years of scouring for the most delicious dish, I had come to a surprising realization. To my own surprise, my motherland had already been serving the best dishes in the world. It was infront of me this entire time, yet only after spending several years tasting hundreds of dishes could I come to this wonderful conclusion. Now, it would be my honor to share these dishes to the rest of the world.</p>
